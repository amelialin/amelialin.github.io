I'm a ukulele enthusiast who enjoys finding, and creating, arrangements for pop songs and top 40 songs on the ukulele. When I first picked up the ukulele in 2012, I wanted to play the songs I heard on the radio. But I found there weren't that many ukulele tabs for pop songs, so I started building my own collection, and writing my own arrangements.

Over the years, I've met more and more people also interested in playing pop on ukulele, so I'm slowly digitizing my collection and sharing them here. I still love finding new stuff and I always keep an ear out for new tunes on the radio!
